#When the registry starts up it will complain, with a stacktrace, 
#that there are no replica nodes for the registry to connect to. In a production environment, 
#you will want more than one instance of the registry. For our simple purposes, however, 
#it sufficies to disable the relevant logging.
#
#By default, the registry will also attempt to register itself, so you need to disable that, as well.
